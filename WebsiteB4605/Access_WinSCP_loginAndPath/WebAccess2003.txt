Hello David. 


There are two options for you while you are learning the process. The
first is to use your own account on plato which you would access via the
URL http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~dschneider. The same password you use to
access e-mail would work. You have to create a sub-directory called .www
and change the read permissions on that and then any file you ftp'ed
into to that would show up on the web. Full instructions are on the MUN
C&C web site. Any files first set up here can be easily moved over
subsequently to the biology site.


The second route is to do everything directly on the biology site which
is accessed through: 
http://www.mun.ca/biology/schneider/b4605. For the time being to ftp
files use an account in my name:
host: plato.ucs.mun.ca
account: pearle
password: ocsmatw%%  (PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS PASSWORD. Other people
are using it too.)


Then change directory to /info/www/docs/biology/schneider/b4605 and add
your files. Be careful though. This is Unix - if you accidentally delete
something important to the biology site then its really gone.


I'm in Europe for the next couple of weeks so you won't be able to
contact me until after May 15. 


Cheers,
Peter
