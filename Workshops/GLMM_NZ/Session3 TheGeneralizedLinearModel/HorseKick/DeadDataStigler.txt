von Bortkiewicz had gone through these 100 volumes and selected the single statistic for death by horse kick,
using the "over all" figure. 

von Bortkewicz wanted to demonstrate what he called "the law of small numbers," to
illustrate that any real differences (such as between years and between Corps of different sizes) would, 
for rare occurrences, be masked by the large Poisson variation. 
Ironically, the data he presented can in modern hands be used to demonstrate a converse of this. 
An analysis by generalized linear models will detect both Corps and year differences.
