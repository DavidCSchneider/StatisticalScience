Quotes

von Bortkiewicz had gone through these 100 volumes and selected the single statistic for death by horse kick,
using the "over all" figure. 

von Bortkewicz wanted to demonstrate what he called "the law of small numbers," to
illustrate that any real differences (such as between years and between Corps of different sizes) would, for rare
occurrences, be masked by the large Poisson variation. Ironically, the data he presented can in modern hands be
used to demonstrate a converse of this. An analysis by generalized linear models will detect both Corps and
year differences.

In all three cases the example was grounded in real data. 
In all three cases, the closer you examine the
situation, the more complicated it becomes. 
There was in each case a large degree of selection of data that was unreported. 
There are errors of transcription and commission (Gossett, Fisher) 
There are doubts about important aspects that cannot be answered at this point in time. 
There are gains from such reexamination of old data—the story
can become much richer statistically (as with von Bortkiewicz). 

But after this investigation it is not possible to view them in the same way as before. 
Scientifically, they are dead data.
